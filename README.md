# DataCleanML
### This project's idea came from a research named cleanML where the researcher finds the five error detection and handling techniques. The five error are missing values,duplicates,outliers,inconsistency,mislabels. After performing data preprocessing the reseacher found out how diffrent preprocessing techniques effect machine learning model's accuracy.  

In the above repository i have created a generalised code for "Missing values","Duplicates","Feature scaling".
